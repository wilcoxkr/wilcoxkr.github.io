My research spans the divide between community and ecosystem ecology, and I am interested in how ecosystem processes vary across time and space. As global change factors like climate shifts, eutrophication, and land use change alter resources within landscapes, this will result in changes in the plant communities that exist there. In turn, these community changes will have strong impacts on important ecosystem functions and services, such as carbon sequestration, forage production, and soil retention. I mostly focus on herbaceous ecosystems, such as grassland and savanna, but the ideas I'm interested in apply to a wide range of different ecosystem types.
