I’m a Senior Biology Undergraduate Student here at UNCG. I joined Dr. Wilcox’s ecology lab through the Undergraduate Research and Creativity Award in Spring of 2024. I’m from Charlotte and plan to begin my journey into the medical field after graduation. Here at UNCG I am on the Executive Board for the Deaf Hearing College Connection, an active member of the Carmichael Film Studios Club, and am a Founding Member of “7IRIS FILMS”, a filmmaker collective.
