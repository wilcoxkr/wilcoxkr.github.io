I am interested in how global change drivers are intensifying disturbance regimes and how these extreme disturbances impact plant communities and ecosystem function. I am exploring these dynamics through empirical research and process-based modeling. Currently, my research looks at the impacts of ‘extreme fires’ in a savanna ecosystem, and how we represent herbaceous plant diversity of these systems in process-based models. I received my B.S. in Environmental Science and Resource Management from the University of Washington. I love hiking and going to trivia with my friends!
