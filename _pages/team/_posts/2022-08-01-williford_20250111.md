I study the impact of global change drivers on ecosystem functioning in savanna ecosystems. My main focus is on tree-grass interactions and how plant traits relate to disturbance response. My study systems are Kruger National Park, South Africa and the Longleaf Pine Savanna in Eastern North Carolina. I recieved a B.S in Environmental Sciences and a B.S. in Plant Biology from North Carolina State University. I love reading, trying new coffee shops, and spending time with my cat, Minerva (named after UNCG's mascot)!
