My research focuses on the interaction between fire and herbivory in grassland ecosystems. Specifically, I am investigating how spatial and temporal heterogeneity of fire and grazing impacts communities and ecosystem functions in tallgrass prairie. I am generally interested in how global change impacts communities and ecosystem functions.
I am from Nigeria! I enjoy playing soccer! I have picked up country swing dance since coming to the US!
